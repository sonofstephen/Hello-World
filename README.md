# Hello-World
This is my first Repo on Github

This ReadMe is a very simple document that currently explains very little since I am yet to understand the complex workings of Github, what is is, and what it is used for. 

So now I have updated this Readme file to reflect the the learning process I am currently undertaking. I am learning to make commits, and to create branches to separate those changes from the Master Branch.
